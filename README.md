# Path Planning Project

I completed this project as part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Self-driving CarData Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). 

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for the car to follow. The highway track has other vehicles, all going different speeds, but approximately obeying the 50 MPH speed limit.

The objective is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. 

We are provided with the car's localization and sensor fusion data. There is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible. 

Note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. 

The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

The map of the highway is in [highway_map.csv](data/highway_map.csv).
Each waypoint in the list contains `[x,y,s,dx,dy]` values. `x` and `y` are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the `dx` and `dy` values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

This is a sample extract from [highway map data](data/highway_map.csv) showing what the data looks like:

```

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

# Details
The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every `(x,y)` point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the `(x,y)` points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The `(x,y)` point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. The previous path's values for `x`, and `y` can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

# Solution Overview

## main.cpp

The majority of the code in [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) is dedicated to handling communications with the simulator. We use the uWebSockets library to communicate with the simulator. The primary event handler for this project is `onMessage()`. 

I implemented a [Handler](src/handler.cpp) to handle the message events from the simulator. Every time an `onMessqage` event is received from the simulator, we call the `handle.HandlePathPlanning()` function. This one function call serves as the entry point to my Path Planning implementation, and abstracts away the details of how I implement path planning. This also means I can try different implementation options without changing the event handling code.   

```c++
...

#include "path_planner.cpp"
#include "trajectory.cpp"
#include "handler.cpp"
#include "waypoints.h"
#include "car.h"

...

int main()
{
  PathPlanner path_planner;
  Trajectory trajectory = Trajectory(&path_planner);
  Handler handler = Handler(&trajectory);
  MapWaypoints map_waypoints;  // map values for waypoint's x,y,s and d normalized normal vectors

  ...
  h.onMessage(
          [&handler, &map_waypoints]
          (uWS::WebSocket<uWS::SERVER> ws, char *data, size_t length,uWS::OpCode opCode)
  {
  ...

      if(event == "telemetry")
      {
          // data for the main car
          CarData car_data = GetCarData(j);
          
          // Define the actual (x,y) points we will use for the planner
          vector<double> next_x_vals;
          vector<double> next_y_vals;
          
          handler.HandlePathPlanning(
                  map_waypoints,
                  car_data,
                  next_x_vals,
                  next_y_vals);

      ...
      }
      ...
}
```

The code first creates a `PathPlanner` object, then uses that to create and initialize a `Trajectory` object. The `Handler` object is created and initialized using the `Trajectory` object.


## Telemetry Data

Here is an example of the telemetry data passed from the simultar in a JSON object.
* `previous_path_x` is an array of doubles, and maps to `CarData.PreviousPath.x` in [car.h](src/car.h)
* `previous_path_y` is an array of doubles, and maps to `CarData.PreviousPath.y` in [car.h](src/car.h)
* `sensor_fusion` data is an array of arrays of doubles, and maps to `CarData.sensor_fusion` in [car.h](src/car.h)

# Design Notes

The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for the car to follow. The highway track has other vehicles, all going different speeds, but approximately obeying the 50 MPH speed limit.

The car transmits its location, along with its sensor fusion data, which estimates the location of all the vehicles on the same side of the road.

## Point Paths
The path planner should output a list of `x` and `y` global map coordinates. Each pair of `x` and `y` coordinates is a point, and all the points together form a trajectory. We can use any number of points that we want, but the `x` list should be the same length as the `y` list.

Every 20 ms the car moves to the next point on the list. The car's new rotation becomes the line between the previous waypoint and the car's new location.

The car moves from point to point perfectly, so we don't have to worry about building a controller for this project.

## Velocity
The velocity of the car depends on the spacing of the points. Because the car moves to a new waypoint every 20ms, the larger the spacing between points, the faster the car will travel. The speed goal is to have the car traveling at (but not above) the 50 MPH speed limit as often as possible. But there will be times when traffic gets in the way.

## Acceleration and Jerk

Acceleration is calculated by comparing the rate of change of average speed over intervals of 0.2 seconds. The jerk is calculated as the average acceleration over 1-second intervals. In order for the passenger to have an enjoyable ride both the jerk and the total acceleration should not exceed 10 m/s^2.

Part of the total acceleration is the normal component, `AccN` which measures the centripetal acceleration from turning. The tighter and faster a turn is made, the higher the `AccN` value will be.

For this project we need to consider how to minimize total acceleration and jerk by gradually increasing and decreasing point path spacing based on the `CarData.Localization.speed` variable.

## Complex Paths

### Using Previous Path Points

Using information from the previous path ensures that there is a smooth transition from cycle to cycle. But the more waypoints we use from the previous path, the less the new path will reflect dynamic changes in the environment.

Ideally, we might only use a few waypoints from the previous path and then generate the rest of the new path based on new data from the car's sensor fusion information.

### Timing
The simulator runs a cycle every 20 ms (50 frames per second), but my C++ path planning program will provide a new path at least one 20 ms cycle behind. The simulator will simply keep progressing down its last given path while it waits for a new generated path.

This means that using previous path data becomes even more important when higher latency is involved. Imagine, for instance, that there is a 500ms delay in sending a new path to the simulator. As long as the new path incorporates a sufficient length of the previous path, the transition will still be smooth.

A concern, though, is how accurately we can predict other traffic 1-2 seconds into the future. An advantage of newly generated paths is that they take into account the most up-to-date state of other traffic.

### Setting Point Paths with Latency
My C++ path planner will at the very least be one cycle behind the simulator because the C++ program can't receive and send data on the same cycle. As a result, any path that the simulator receives will be from the perspective of a previous cycle. This might mean that by the time a new path reaches the simulator, the vehicle has already passed the first few waypoints on that path.

Luckily we don't have to worry about this too much for this project. The simulator has built-in tools to deal with this timing difference. The simulator actually expects the received path to be a little out of date compared to where the car is, and the simulator will consider which point on the received path is closest to the car and adjust appropriately.

## Highway Map

### About the Highway
* The [map file](data/highway_map.csv) contains a list of waypoints that go all the way around the track. 
* The track contains a total of 181 waypoints, with the last waypoint mapping back around to the first. The waypoints are in the middle of the double-yellow dividing line in the center of the highway.
* The track is 6945.554 meters around (about 4.32 miles). If the car averages near 50 MPH, then it should take a little more than 5 minutes for it to go all the way around the highway.
* The highway has 6 lanes total - 3 heading in each direction. Each lane is 4 m wide and the car should only ever be in one of the 3 lanes on the right-hand side. The car should always be inside a lane unless doing a lane change.

### Waypoints and Highway Measurements
Each waypoint has an `(x,y)` global map position, and a Frenet s value and Frenet d unit normal vector (split up into the `x` component, and the `y` component).

The `s` value is the distance along the direction of the road. The first waypoint has an s value of `0` because it is the starting point.

The `d` vector has a magnitude of `1` and points perpendicular to the road in the direction of the right-hand side of the road. The `d` vector can be used to calculate lane positions. For example, if you want to be in the left lane at some waypoint just add the waypoint's `(x,y)` coordinates with the `d` vector multiplied by 2. Since the lane is 4 m wide, the middle of the left lane (the lane closest to the double-yellow dividing line) is 2 m from the waypoint.

If you would like to be in the middle lane, add the waypoint's coordinates to the `d` vector multiplied by 6 = (2+4), since the center of the middle lane is 4 m from the center of the left lane, which is itself 2 m from the double-yellow dividing line and the waypoints.
### Converting Frenet Coordinates

There is a helper function, `Frenet2Cartesian()`, in [coordinate_transforms.h](src/coordinate_transforms.h) which takes in Frenet `(s,d)` coordinates and transforms them to `(x,y)` coordinates.

### Interpolating Points

To estimate the location of points between the known waypoints, we need to "interpolate" the position of those points.

Once we have a polynomial function, we can use it to interpolate the location of a new point.

There are also other methods we could use. For example, Bezier curve fitting with control points, or spline fitting, which guarantees that the generated function passes through every point.


## Sensor Fusion

It is important that the car does not crash into any of the other vehicles on the road, all of which are moving at different speeds around the speed limit and can change lanes.

The `sensor_fusion` variable contains all the information about the cars on the right-hand side of the road.

The data format for each car is: `[ id, x, y, vx, vy, s, d]`. 
* The `id` is a unique identifier for that car. 
* The `x, y` values are in global map coordinates.
* The `vx, vy` values are the velocity components, also in reference to the global map. 
* Finally `s` and `d` are the Frenet coordinates for that car.

The `vx, vy` values can be useful for predicting where the cars will be in the future. For instance, if you were to assume that the tracked car kept moving along the road, then its future predicted Frenet `s` value will be its current `s` value plus its (transformed) total velocity (m/s) multiplied by the time elapsed into the future (s).

## Changing Lane

The last consideration is how to create paths that can smoothly changes lanes. Any time the ego vehicle approaches a car in front of it that is moving slower than the speed limit, the ego vehicle should consider changing lanes.

The car should only change lanes if such a change would be safe, and also if the lane change would help it move through the flow of traffic better.

For safety, a lane change path should optimize the distance away from other traffic. For comfort, a lane change path should also result in low acceleration and jerk. The acceleration and jerk part can be solved from linear equations for `s` and `d` functions. Examples of this can be found in "Quintic Polynomial Solver" and "Polynomial Trajectory".

The `Eigen-3.3` library can solve such linear equations. The `Frenet2Cartesian` helper function can transform `(s,d)` points to `(x,y)` points for the returned path.
